# 3DHeals Event Analytics - ALY 6080

## Project Overview
This repository hosts the final project for the ALY 6080 Integrated Experiential Learning course. Our team collaborated with 3DHeals, a healthcare technology company specializing in 3D printing, to analyze their event data. Our goal was to provide actionable insights that enhance attendee engagement and optimize event planning.

## Project Components
- **Attendee Segmentation**: We clustered event attendees to better understand their demographics and preferences.
- **Event Attendance Prediction**: Using machine learning models, we predicted future event attendance, aiding in resource planning.
- **Session Optimization**: We analyzed session engagement metrics to suggest improvements in content and scheduling.
- **Consent Management**: We assessed attendee consent preferences to guide data usage and privacy practices.
- **Sponsorship and Marketing Analysis**: We evaluated the effectiveness of sponsors and marketing channels in driving event attendance.
- **Feedback Analysis**: Utilized natural language processing to extract insights from session feedback.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Python**: For data cleaning, manipulation, and model building.
- **Excel**: For initial exploratory data analysis.
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Including decision trees, clustering, and predictive modeling.
